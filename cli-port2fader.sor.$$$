I'd like to re-open this issue as I have come up with one possible solution.

If we use the client port as a "key" we can request a fader position by seeding the call to getfreeslot()

How this will work for a choir is each part will have a designated port to start with see table...

Soprano	-p 22310
Alto	-p 22320
Tenor	-p 22330
Bass	-p 22340

This is 4 divisions but more granularity is possible and any failures will roll over to using the default slots
